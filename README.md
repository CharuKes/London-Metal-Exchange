# Precious Metal Prices and Economic Points of Interest 

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing three key economic metrics in the UK: inflation, GDP, and interest rates. Additionally, it delves into the dynamics of four precious metals - gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. The goal is to provide insights into economic performance and offer investment advice based on short-term and long-term criteria. 

## Precious Metals

The chosen precious metals are gold, silver, platinum, and palladium. These metals are selected based on rarity, manufacturing process, and historical significance. Gold, in particular, is recognized as an inflation hedge and a safe haven during economic difficulties. 
 
## Economic Metrics

We examine the following economic metrics:

1. **Inflation:** A measure of the general increase in prices of goods and services, indicating the decrease in purchasing power of a currency.

2. **GDP (Gross Domestic Product):** The total value of goods and services produced in a country, serving as a crucial indicator of economic health.

3. **Interest Rates:** The cost of borrowing or the return on investment, influenced by the Bank of England's decisions based on economic performance.

Supplementary information is included to offer a more detailed understanding, such as exploring energy prices as an explanation for inflation in specific periods.

## Time Frames for Investment Advice

Investment advice is categorized into four criteria:

1. **Short Term High Risk:** 1 to 36 months investment period, potential for high gains with high risk.
2. **Short Term Low Risk:** 1 to 36 months investment period, stable asset with lower potential gains.
3. **Long Term High Risk:** 3+ years investment period, potential for large gains with market shocks.
4. **Long Term Low Risk:** 3+ years investment period, consistent growth, less susceptible to market shocks.

Risk levels change over time, with established assets becoming less risky as they ride out market fluctuations.

## Returns Predictor

The project includes a returns predictor application that employs a machine learning model to forecast future prices of the precious metals. Users can input the investment period and initial value to estimate potential returns.

## Economic Forecast

Utilizing historical data, the economic forecast component predicts potential outcomes for GDP and inflation over the next 10 years. While interest rates are influenced by the Bank of England's reactions to economic performance, predictions for these are included as well.
